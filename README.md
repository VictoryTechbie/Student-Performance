## Introduction
<p align="justify">
In today’s data-driven educational environment, tracking and understanding student performance is crucial for informed decision-making. This project analyzed student scores in Math, Reading, and Writing, with emphasis on gender differences and subject-wise performance patterns. The findings were visualized in an interactive Excel dashboard to help educators, school administrators, and policymakers identify performance gaps and areas for improvement. The analysis explores academic outcomes, highlights patterns in subject-wise performance, and provides insights into potential factors affecting students’ results. The goal is to create an easy-to-understand dashboard that helps schools, teachers, and decision-makers assess progress and areas needing intervention.

## Problem Statement
<p align="justify">
	Many schools and education administrators struggle to monitor and evaluate student performance trends over time. Without proper tools and insights, it's difficult to identify gaps in performance across gender, subjects, or student groups. This project aims to develop an interactive Excel dashboard that visualizes school performance, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions for academic improvement.
